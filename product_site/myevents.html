            In the My Events section, users can view all of the events that they have saved to their account.
            This feature allows users to keep track of the events that they are interested in attending, and
            provides them with a convenient way to access information about these events. Users can view the
            date, time, and location of each event, as well as how much tickets are going for. Users can
            also view when tickets for their saved events are most likely going to drop in price.
