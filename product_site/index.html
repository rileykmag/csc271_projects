        <strong>TicTrack</strong> is a product meant to help users obtain more affordable tickets to events.
        Ticket buying can be a hassle, especially with how <em>competitive</em> sales have been as of late, 
        and <strong>TicTrack</strong> aims to make it <em>easier</em> for users to find the best deals. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With <strong>TicTrack</strong>, users will be able to search for the events that they would like to attend, 
        and then select the tickets that they would like to purchase. Once these tickets have been 
        selected, the users will be able to compare the prices of these tickets across several platforms 
        and get alerted for when there are changes in cost.
    </p>
    <p>
        This product is valuable because it will <em>save users time and money</em>. Instead of anxiously checking
        multiple websites for the best deal, users can simply use <strong>TicTrack</strong> to do the work for them. The 
        notification system will keep the user up to date on the best deals, and the comparison feature 
        will allow them to make the best decision for their budget. <strong>TicTrack</strong> also has an added feature 
        where it will provide predictions on when ticket prices will drop, so users will have a higher 
        chance at securing more affordable tickets.
